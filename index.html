		<h1>Narrative Writing</h1>
		<p id="Introduction">Heart breaking, but we are only truly broken if we let ourselves fall; even though my circumstances were unexpected, a living nightmare, I never let go of my fighting passion. I have walked, ran, crawled, and stumbled down the road that I so curiously yet lifelessly follow. Lifelessly because most days I feel as if I’m a ghost, a ghost of what my disorder could or couldn’t make me be. A ghost to people that meant so much to me and yet, they still left me down on my knees in the dirt with a knife in my back. Remembering and drifting with every scream I let slip both in and outside of my mind. While I was “never” supposed to make it, this disorder took the majority of my teenage life away from me, the people I cared about the most left me to be alone in my hardships all because It caused me to be unable to carry my own weight, struggling to walk, and heartbroken; people don't want to be friends with someone who isn't "normal"; despite that hardship, I never gave up. </p>

		<p id="Paragraph2">I have been what you would call a medical mystery since birth. Feeling like my whole life is a lie when my whole life I was lied too because my disorder is as old as me. Fibromyalgia, a central nervous system disorder (CNS disorder), was only recognized as a real disorder 20 years ago in 2003. The year I was born in. Born with skin as white as snow, so small, so fragile. Dead at birth and brought back to life by the doctor who delivered me. That’s where the connection between me and fibromyalgia began because I must have been gone long enough to cause it. Allowing it to make its roots and to manipulate my body to be 10 times its potential sensitivity, creating a world of problems for me. Sometimes there is such a thing as too much.</p>
		
		<p id="Paragraph3">What exactly do I mean by manipulating my body though? You know how people often manipulate others to hide the truth or a demon pretending to be something its not to lure you in? Almost like how the candy man seems so sweet, but then he turns you into the candy instead. Imagine a disorder that could mimic every medical condition in the book when really, it’s all in your head. But, it’s not in your head because then you’re the liar instead, it is your head. CNS disorders are categorized as brain disorders, which means my disorder tricks my brain into thinking there’s danger, pain, fear, or a reason to be afraid. That’s not all, the pain I feel is real because my brain increased my limitations causing irritation and inflammation of my central nervous system and muscle tissue surrounding my nerve endings.</p>

		<p id="Paragraph4">Causing all these questions to arise that I couldn’t get answers to. Teenagers naturally feel lost or out of place as it is due to their hormone imbalances and life choices. Having a whole body out of place and rewired unable to untangle its roots feels like chains wrapping around my wrists and ankles, pulling me tightly against a wall I can’t break through to my true self within, screaming for everyone to hear me. Whispering to myself that I’ll get out of here, but where? I must use a cane like my own left leg, wear braces at every joint, and can’t even hold a pencil. I can hear myself, but the doctors and the world aren’t listening. Excuse after excuse is what they gave me to all the questions I gave them. Causing me to question myself. All I could see was the dreadful look on my mother’s face helplessly watching me in pain. She had questions that needed answers too. Like what would you do if you hopelessly couldn’t help your child who screams out for help, but all she gets is turned heads? </p>

		<p id="Paragraph5">Turned heads and turned backs is something I got all my life not just by doctors, but also by friends. People I loved more than life itself just when it came to my life, their life had more value to them than I ever did. Even if we were all just teenagers becoming adolescents. A bunch of 17–20-year-olds who clearly are still kids, we are still old enough to know right from wrong. Defined, judged, an outcast is a label that isn’t new to me. That is something I wouldn’t have learned at a young age if it wasn’t for my CNS disorder. When you’re someone that doesn’t fit in makes you question if you should be trying to fit in seeing how many people aren’t trying themselves to fit into your life. I guess that’s what they mean when they say someone isn’t for you or the definition of having a fake friend. Life shouldn’t be about fitting in, but about being accepted for who you are. Having to go through those rejections with a CNS disorder that can easily be triggered by stress or trauma of my emotional self makes the pain inside worse. It became only natural for me to be depressed, dull in the face, muting myself from all the pain in my throat, and holding back every tear that glossed my eyes. </p>

        <p id="Paragraph6">All so long ago now, but I can still feel it lingering somewhere in the back of my mind where it had me hidden. Calling my name in the voices of those who left me there. How poetically ironic isn’t it? At least now I can lay out all my insecurities and tell everyone that I’m scared. Stand up to myself, for myself, and carry my own weight. Drifting from every wind that blows my way. I smile looking back at the only people who are running with me down the same road I used to stumble down. I hated myself, but now I have learned to love myself more than those who left me there. Watching them as they all ran ahead, it was for the best. Because they can run, but I have true friends who will pick me up when I fall again. I pray that day may never come again. I’ve come such a long way, and it was exhausting.</p>
        
        <p id="Paragraph7">People still tend to have their doubts, their single stories about me, but what they forgot was it's about me. I may not be a hero, but I’m also not a villain either. Instead, I’m a dreamer that uses her dreams to build things and make it her reality. Having a CNS disorder that made me struggle, I’m the 50% percent chance I’ll grow out of it. So open-minded it’s dangerous, sensitive, fragile, but so beautiful, and embracive. My younger self would be so proud if she could see herself now. Having a body that was re-wired and not letting it be an excuse to stop her. Learning to wire and connect software’s of her own, building websites, programming, and showing people how easy change can really be. Expected or unexpected, everything calls for change. My change was growing intelligently to fix myself as so is my purpose to change the way things work. </p>
